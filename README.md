# 🥿 "Sole Justice" - Open Source 3D Political Protest Game 🥿

**Join the Global Movement - Code for Justice!**

Inspired by the legendary Bush shoe-throwing incident that sparked viral games like "Sock and Awe" (which reached 49 million throws in just 4 days), we're building the next generation of political protest gaming.

## 🎯 The Mission

Create a powerful 3D React-based game where players can express their outrage against ongoing injustices through the symbolic act of shoe-throwing - a gesture that carries deep cultural significance as a grave insult in the Arab world.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- **Historical Precedent**: The original Bush shoe games went viral instantly, proving the power of political gaming
- **Cultural Impact**: Following the tradition of journalist Muntadar al-Zaidi, whose brave act inspired dozens of copycat games
- **Modern Technology**: Leveraging React and 3D graphics for immersive political expression

## 🚀 Calling All Developers Worldwide!

We need YOU to help build:

- ⚛️ **React/Three.js 3D Engine** - Realistic physics and animations
- 🎮 **Game Mechanics** - Scoring, difficulty levels, multiplayer modes
- 🎨 **Visual Design** - Compelling 3D environments and character models
- 🌐 **Internationalization** - Multi-language support for global reach
- 📱 **Cross-Platform** - Web, mobile, and desktop compatibility

## 💪 Join the Resistance Through Code

This isn't just a game - it's a digital form of peaceful protest, following the legacy of games that gave voice to the voiceless. Every line of code you contribute helps amplify the call for justice.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + React Three Fiber
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with WebGL
- **Physics**: Custom physics engine for realistic projectile motion
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with tech battlefield aesthetics
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

## 🎮 Current Features

- **Third-person camera** with mouse-controlled aiming
- **Physics-based throwing** with realistic gravity and projectile motion
- **Power charging system** - longer hold = faster throw
- **Golden trail effects** following thrown projectiles
- **Enemy AI** - Moving targets with varying speeds
- **Scoring system** - Base score + combo multipliers
- **Tech battlefield environment** - Futuristic 3D arena

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

## 🎯 How to Play

- **Mouse Movement**: Rotate weapon left/right to aim (45-75° range)
- **Click & Hold**: Charge throw power (watch power bar fill)
- **Release**: Throw projectile at enemy!

## 🏆 Scoring System

- **Base Score**: 100 points per hit
- **Combo Bonus**: +50 points per combo level
